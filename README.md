âŒ¨ Task-9: Autocomplete & Autocorrect Data Analytics â€“ Oasis Infobyte Internship ðŸ¤–

As part of my Data Science & Machine Learning Internship at Oasis Infobyte, I worked on Task-9, where I explored the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build an Autocomplete & Autocorrect system.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

The objective was to process and analyze text data, then develop models that predict the next word a user might type (autocomplete) and correct spelling mistakes (autocorrect) using Python & NLP techniques.

ðŸ›  Steps Involved:

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing â€“ Tokenized sentences, removed punctuation, normalized text, and handled stopwords.
ðŸ”¹ Autocomplete â€“ Implemented using n-grams and probability-based predictions from word sequences.
ðŸ”¹ Autocorrect â€“ Used Levenshtein distance to suggest corrections for misspelled words.
ðŸ”¹ Performance Evaluation â€“ Tested model accuracy with real-world sentences.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:

âœ” NLP-powered systems significantly improve typing efficiency and user experience.
âœ” Frequent word pairings and context-driven predictions yield higher accuracy in autocomplete.
âœ” Edit distance algorithms are effective for spelling correction, even in noisy text.
